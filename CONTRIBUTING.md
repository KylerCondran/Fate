# General Ideas

- allegiance flag on monsters (traitor gun? swaps allegiance)

- udder gun dropped by cow king
- army base has huge fight between factions, winning faction helps you in mothership level
- cheat codes
- warcraft level, human knights and orcs, ogre mage
- melee axe / katana
- energy shield / physical shield that absorbs 1000 dmg
- ufos hover side to side when attacking
- enemies no longer stack
- ufo tractor beams?
- enemy ai, patroling, fleeing
- upgrade assets, make matrix for missing artifacts
- army vs terminators
- rhino charging
- dead bones decay system
- alien2 should have burst fire
- witch doctors can teleport you to random places on the map
